# Speech Progress Estimation

This is a research-based project aimed at predicting how much of a speech 
has been completed (in percentage) without relying on the full transcript.  
We estimate this based on partial input â€” such as semantic features, 
speech structure, and content progression, from live or recorded 
speeches.
