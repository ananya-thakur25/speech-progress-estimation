# Speech Progress Estimation

This is a research-based project aimed at predicting how much of a speech 
has been completed (in percentage) without relying on the full transcript.  
We estimate this based on partial input ‚Äî such as semantic features, 
speech structure, and content progression, from live or recorded 
speeches.
# üß† Topic Modeling Analysis for Speech Completion Prediction

The Jupyter notebook implements the core logic of topic modeling-based speech progress estimation. It processes speech transcripts, identifies semantic topics in chunks, and computes topic saturation to estimate the percentage of speech completed.

## üöÄ Objectives

- Segment transcripts into 3 sentence chunks
- Assign topic labels using BERTopic (Transformer-based topic modeling)
- Track cumulative topic coverage across chunks
- Detect topic saturation using an adaptive window method
- Estimate speech completion percentage using topic dynamics


## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.11+
- Jupyter Notebook
- `BERTopic`
- `UMAP`, `HDBSCAN`
- `NLTK` (for sentence chunking)
- `Scikit-learn` (RandomForestRegressor)
- `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`


## üìå Key Methods

### Chunking
Transcripts are broken into chunks of 3 sentences using NLTK's sentence tokenizer.

### Topic Modeling
BERTopic is applied on each chunk:
- Embeddings: BERT-based
- Dimensionality reduction: UMAP
- Clustering: HDBSCAN
- Output: Topic labels (`Topic_Label`)

### Outlier Handling
Chunks labeled as `-1` are reassigned using a **group-wise majority vote** within each speech (grouped by `VideoTitle`).

### üìè Completion Estimation

**Completion % = (Saturation Chunk / Total Chunks) √ó 100**
